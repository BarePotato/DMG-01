# DMG-01

An educational Gameboy Emulator in Rust and its companion book!

## Goals

The goals of this project are educational. While the Game Boy runs (erm... will one day run) most major Game Boy games, the aim is not to make the most acurate emulator. The emulator should be easy to understand and easy to use. If you're looking for a highly accurate emulator you might have better look with [mooneye-gb](https://github.com/Gekkio/mooneye-gb) or [BGB](http://bgb.bircd.org/).
